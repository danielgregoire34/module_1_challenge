# Code Refactor Starter Code
# for the html section i divided the sections in header, section 1 and 2, and lastly footer 
# my goal for html was to replace as many divs as possible with less and cleaner code.

# for the css i tried to get rid of as much duplicate code as i could andd just condense it
